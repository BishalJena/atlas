About AIDP
AIDP is a decentralized GPU compute network. We power global AI, ZK, gaming, rendering, HPC, and scientific workloads. We use staking, proofs, and decentralized routing to offer high-performance, verifiable, and low-cost GPU compute to builders worldwide.

Mission
Build or bring projects that need GPU compute to AIDP and earn rewards.

Scope Detail
This campaign runs for 2 weeks and you have two ways to earn:

Option 1 - Build a Project Using AIDP GPU Compute

Create anything that runs GPU workloads on AIDP.

This could be AI agents, ZK proof generators, game engines, render systems, scientific compute apps, DePIN dashboards, or custom GPU pipelines.

Your project qualifies if it uses AIDP compute at least once.

Option 2 - Bring an Existing Project That Needs GPU Compute

Refer a project or team that needs GPU acceleration for things like AI inference, 3D/video generation, ZK proofs, or heavy simulations.

To be eligible for the referral reward, the project you bring must submit, integrate AIDP GPUs, list on the AIDP marketplace, and credit you as the referrer.

AIDP supports any workload that requires GPU power, including:

AI / LLM applications

Gaming & real-time rendering

Zero-knowledge proof systems

HPC & scientific compute

3D pipelines & video generation

Simulations, analytics, and DePIN tools

Any compute-heavy project

Submission Requirements
Whether you build or bring a project, your submission must include:

AIDP Marketplace Project Page

Public GitHub Repository (with working code)

Social Media Link (Twitter/X)

1–2 minute Demo Video

Clear explanation of GPU usage on AIDP

For recruited projects, include the referrer’s name/wallet.

All submissions must be in English.

Judging Criteria
Prizes are awarded based on:

Technical execution

GPU integration depth

Product quality

Creativity & originality

User experience & design

Vision & long-term scalability

Social proof & community traction

Quality of project

Depth of AIDP compute usage

Value added to the ecosystem

Reward Structure
