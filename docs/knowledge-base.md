## 🏗️ Architecture

The AIDP network consists of four main node types:

### 1. Compute Nodes
- Provide raw GPU/CPU power for AI model training and inference
- Execute computational workloads

### 2. Storage Nodes
- Handle decentralized data storage
- Store datasets and model weights

### 3. Bandwidth Nodes
- Optimize data transfer across the network
- Ensure efficient communication between nodes

### 4. Orchestration Nodes (Phase 2)
- Coordinate job distribution
- Manage the compute graph
- Token-staked for reliability

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

```
Client → Orchestration Node → Compute Provider → Verification → Settlement → Rewards
```

---

## ✅ Verification & Trust

AIDP uses cryptographic proofs to ensure compute jobs are executed correctly and verifiably without centralized oversight:

- **PoR** - Proof of Resources
- **PoD** - Proof of Delivery
- **PoU** - Proof of Usage

---

## 💰 Economic Model

- **Tokenized incentives** for node operators
- **Staking models** for compute providers
- **DAT (Decentralized AI Treasury)** - Supports buybacks and burns
- **Settlement Layer** - Supports Solana and EVM compatible chains for financial coordination and rewards
